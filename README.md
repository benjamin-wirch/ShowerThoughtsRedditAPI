# ShowerThoughtsRedditAPI
Reads in data from the r/Showerthoughts subreddit utilizing the Reddit API for an LCD display using a Raspberry Pi Zero W

Just a fun little weekend project to get more experience using APIs, Python, and Raspberry PI hardware :)


## Try it yourself!

Go to https://reddit.com/prefs/apps and create a new script app all the way at the bottom of the page

Download this repo and edit the keys.py file with your newly created Client ID and Secret Key from the website above

Edit SUBREDDIT in main.py if you wish to change subreddits (default: r/Showerthoughts)

Enjoy!


## To-do:

Implement software for Raspberry Pi to output display to screen

Expand program to extract more than just the titles of posts (this is being used right now for things such as breaking news, r/Showerthoughts, and sports updates)
